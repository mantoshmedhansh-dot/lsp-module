## Part 8: Gap Analysis

|----------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| Visibility | $1.5B+ | 4-5 majors | Mature, consolidating |
| Procurement AI | $500M+ | 5-6 leaders | Hot, growing |
| Planning/S&OP | $700M+ | 2-3 leaders | Enterprise only |

| Inventory | $500M+ | 2-3 leaders | Mature |

### Unfunded / Underserved Gaps

|-----|-----------------|-------------|
| **SMB S&OP** | All players enterprise-focused | Progressive adoption, self-service |
| **Decision Trace Capture** | Not on anyone's roadmap | Governance layer for AI |
| **Cross-functional Context** | Siloed by function | Unified decision memory |
| **Outcome-based Pricing** | Everyone on SaaS model | Pay-per-decision |
| **Fast Time-to-Value** | 12+ weeks minimum | Days, not months |

---

## Part 9: Investment Thesis Implications

### For a "Decision Trace" S&OP Play

**Competitive Position:**
- Don't compete with o9/Kinaxis on optimization
- Don't compete with project44/FourKites on visibility
- Don't compete with Zip/Pactum on procurement automation

**White Space:**
1. **SMB Market** - No one serves companies <$100M revenue
2. **Decision Governance** - No one captures how/why decisions were made
3. **Progressive Adoption** - Even "modular" requires months of implementation
4. **Context Persistence** - Decisions are made, context is lost

**Potential Positioning:**
> "The decision intelligence layer that sits above planning systems, capturing the exceptions, approvals, and precedents that make S&OP work. Start in days, not months."

### Comparable Valuations

| Company | Funding | Valuation | Revenue Multiple (Est) |
|---------|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| o9 | $533M | $3.7B | 15-20x ARR |
| Zip | $190M | $2.2B | 30-40x ARR |
| project44 | $912M | $2.7B | 10-15x ARR |
| RELEX | $500M+ | $5.4B | 15-20x ARR |

**Pattern:** AI-native platforms command 20-40x ARR multiples.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Procurement AI is hottest** - Zip, Pactum showing what "agentic" looks like in practice

2. **Visibility is maturing** - project44, FourKites are cash-flow positive, less upside

3. **S&OP is enterprise-only** - o9 dominates, but leaves massive SMB gap

4. **Decision traces don't exist** - No one is capturing governance context

5. **Time-to-value is opportunity** - Even fastest (Kinaxis) is 12 weeks

6. **Outcome pricing is coming** - Intercom proved it works ($0.99/resolved ticket)
