# The Repricing of Software

> Reference document captured: 2026-01-18

## Summary

The market is repricing the entire SaaS business model because seat-driven expansion (packaged as predictable ARR) is colliding with a world where outcomes can scale without headcount.

---

## Key Thesis

**Seat-based pricing is a proxy for labor.** If your revenue model depends on how many humans are doing the work, you are implicitly betting that digital output scales by adding people.

**Agentic AI breaks that assumption.** When buyers believe outcomes can scale without seats, the premium multiple collapses first—long before revenue does.

---

## Historical Parallel

This has happened twice before:

1. **Mainframes → PCs**: Mainframes didn't disappear because they stopped working—they stayed mission-critical but disappeared as a growth story because the economics broke when compute became cheap, distributed, and flexible.

2. **Client-Server → SaaS**: On-prem didn't stop functioning, but subscription delivery, continuous updates, easier deployment, and faster scaling created a financial structure the market could underwrite with premium multiples.

**Now that same financial structure is what's being attacked.**

## Why Multiples Are Compressing

- CRM sector went from ~40x FCF (2023) to ~16-18x today
- Market isn't saying products have no value
- Market is saying the old valuation logic can't be trusted anymore

### Mechanics Making Investors Nervous

1. **Implementation moat eroding**: Long deployments, consultants, integrations created switching costs. AI compresses this—agents can translate configs, generate connectors, rewrite scripts.

2. **Perceived friction falling**: Even if switching isn't "easy," perception is what reprices multiples.

3. **Feature supply explosion**: Building incremental features is cheaper than ever. Long-term margin structure for "nice to have" SaaS gets ugly.

4. **Value migration**: Away from screens/UI toward control points that cannot be bypassed:
   - Security enforcement
   - Identity
   - Networking
   - Data gravity
   - Systems that run the enterprise (not decorate it)

## The Buyer Has the Upper Hand Again

Enterprise buyers now have credible alternatives:
- Hyperscaler bundles
- Open-source frameworks
- Internal tooling

They don't need to rip out every vendor—just need credible alternatives to negotiate pricing and slow expansion.

**Once expansion slows, the entire SaaS flywheel wobbles** because the model was designed around net retention driven by seat growth and module creep.

---

## Three Buckets That Matter

### Bucket 1: AI Increases Importance
Companies where AI makes what they do MORE critical:
- Security
- Networking
- Enforcement

(Attack surfaces explode as agents proliferate)

### Bucket 2: Workflow Substrate for Agents
Platforms that become the place where work gets:
- Routed
- Audited
- Permissioned
- Executed

Enterprises will need orchestration as complexity rises.

### Bucket 3: Application SaaS (Under Pressure)
The long tail where:
- Product is basically screens on top of someone else's data
- Value can be delivered by an agent without paying for the seat

**This bucket is where the market is being ruthless.**

## Investment Implications

### What Unlocks Recovery
NOT a single earnings beat, but proof across multiple quarters that growth is tied to:
- Usage
- Control points
- Outcome capture

Rather than:
- Headcount expansion
- Feature velocity

### Timeline
**Software is a 2027 story.** Until investors have clarity on who captures pricing power when outcomes scale without seats:
- Money stays tight
- Multiples stay compressed
- Software trades like a sector in exile

Once proof shows up, capital will come back quickly.

## Key Quotes

> "The UI layer gets commoditized because the output becomes the product."

> "The bar has moved from 'good product with recurring revenue' to 'owns a control point in a world where work becomes autonomous.'"

> "What we're watching is a structural debate about where value accrues in the agentic stack."
