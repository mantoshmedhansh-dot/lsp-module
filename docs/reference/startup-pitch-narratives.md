## Part 1: Prukalpa Sankar (Atlan) - Enterprise AI Thesis

### About Prukalpa

- Co-founder & Co-CEO of Atlan (data catalog / metadata platform)
- Forbes 30 Under 30, Fortune 40 Under 40, TED Speaker
- Previously founded SocialCops (built India's National Data Platform)
- Atlan: $105M Series C (May 2024), $750M valuation, led by GIC + Meritech

### The "Context is King" Framework

**Core Thesis (2025):**
> "In 1996, Bill Gates wrote 'content is king.' In 2025, you can actually say in this new era, **context is king**."

**Why This Matters for AI:**
> "The problem of data management has almost become 10x more important because of AI. Because **AI can't do anything without context**."

### The AI-Ready Data Problem

Prukalpa identifies the core bottleneck:
> "The main hurdle isn't AI models but the **lack of AI-ready data** - data enriched with business context, trust, and security."

**What's Missing:**
- Not raw data (that's everywhere)
- Context: what does this data mean?
- Trust: can I rely on this?
- Lineage: where did it come from?
- Governance: who can access it?

### Decision Traces in Metadata

Prukalpa's concept aligns with Jaya Gupta's "context graphs":

| Jaya Gupta (Foundation Capital) | Prukalpa (Atlan) |
|--------------------------------|------------------|
| "Decision traces" | "Active metadata" |
| Capture how decisions were made | Capture business context around data |
| Make precedent searchable | Make metadata queryable by agents |
| Systems of agents own execution path | Metadata layer powers AI agents |

### Atlan's MCP Server

Atlan built a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server** - a bridge between metadata and AI tools:
- Works with Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Microsoft Copilot
- AI agents can search assets, explore lineage, update metadata
- Uses real-time context from Atlan

### On AI Adoption

**The 75%→100% Problem:**
> "It's so much harder to take an AI system from 75% reliable to 100% than it is to go from 0 to 75."

**Change Management:**
> "Don't force it. Take technology to your users - don't bring your users to the technology."

### Relevance to S&OP / Supply Chain

While Prukalpa doesn't specifically address S&OP, her thesis applies directly:

| Her Principle | S&OP Application |
|--------------|------------------|
| Context is king | S&OP decisions need historical context |
| AI needs AI-ready data | Demand/supply data needs business meaning |
| Metadata as fabric | Decision traces connect planning silos |
| Show up where users work | Embed in existing ERP/planning tools |

## Part 3: Successful AI Pivot Stories

### The Playbook: From SaaS to AI

#### Vivun: Most Instructive Example

**Before:** SaaS for sales engineers, $10M ARR, $500M+ valuation (2022)
**Crisis:** Growth "froze in time" after 2022

**The Pivot Narrative:**
> "There simply wasn't going to be a future where people interacted with our software the way they do today. The world of SaaS tools will eventually be killed by AI-native interfaces, so we needed to start over."

**From:** "Providing a SaaS system to keep track of work done by humans"
**To:** "Providing an AI system that could do the work itself"

**Results:**
- Projected $10M ARR from AI product in 2024
- Expected to triple in 2025
- Would eclipse 4-year SaaS business in 18 months

**Cost:** Laid off more than half the staff

---

#### Intercom: From Chat to AI-Native

**Before:** Customer messaging platform (live chat, help centers)
**After:** "AI-first customer service company"

**Investment:** $100M+ in AI development

**Results:**
- Fin resolves 1M+ support tickets/week
- Equivalent to 6,500+ human agents
- Revenue: 10% growth (2023) → 25% growth (2024) to $343M

**Pricing Innovation:**
$0.99 per AI-resolved ticket (outcome-based)

---

#### Writer: From Writing Tool to Full-Stack AI

**Before:** AI writing assistant (evolved from localization platform)
**After:** "Full-stack generative AI platform for enterprise"

**Results:**
- $2M ARR (2022) → $47M ARR (2024)
- $200M Series C at $1.9B valuation

**Why They Succeeded (vs Jasper):**
- Built proprietary models
- Deep enterprise integrations
- Not just a "GPT wrapper"

---

### The Cautionary Tale: Jasper

**What Happened:**
- Early AI writing darling
- $131M raised at $1.5B valuation
- Revenue: $120M (2023) → $55M (2024)
- Both co-founders stepped down

**Why They Failed:**
1. "GPT wrapper" with no moat
2. ChatGPT commoditized their offering
3. No deep enterprise integrations
4. First-mover advantage proved temporary

## Part 4: What VCs Want to See

### The Evaluation Framework

#### Green Flags

| Signal | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Founder-market fit** | Domain expertise is the moat |
| **Proprietary data/models** | Can't be replicated with API call |
| **Vertical specialization** | "Future of AI is vertical" |
| **Outcome-based pricing** | Proves value, aligns incentives |
| **Revenue velocity** | $0→$1M ARR in months is new bar |
| **Deep integrations** | 18-24 months to replicate |

#### Red Flags

|--------|-------------------|
| "GPT wrapper" | No defensibility |
| Horizontal without depth | Easy to commoditize |
| Demo-driven, no traction | Can't prove real value |
| No technical founders | Can't evolve with models |
| Growth-at-all-costs | VCs now reward efficiency |

### The Magic Numbers

| Metric | What Good Looks Like |
|--------|---------------------|
| Time to $1M ARR | 4-6 months |
| ARR growth | 3-4x year-over-year |
| Gross margin | Positive on AI pricing |
| Resolution/success rate | 70-90% |
| Customer satisfaction | 95%+ |

## Part 5: Narrative Templates

### Template 1: "The Obsolescence Pivot"

```
"We realized [our existing product] was going to be made obsolete by AI.

Instead of waiting to be disrupted, we became the disruptor.

We went from [providing tools for humans] to [AI that does the work].

In [X months], our AI product will eclipse [Y years] of our SaaS business."
```

**Used by:** Vivun, Intercom

---

### Template 2: "The Domain Expert"

```
"I spent [X years] at [industry leader] building [relevant systems].

That gave me a real advantage in knowing what [target customers] actually need.

[Problem statement from insider perspective].

We're building [solution] because we've lived this problem."
```

**Used by:** Gradient Labs, Harvey

---

### Template 3: "The Context Layer"

```
"AI can't do anything without context.

[Industry/function] generates [decision traces / metadata / context].

But it's trapped in [Slack / spreadsheets / people's heads].

We capture this context and make it [searchable / actionable / autonomous]."
```

**Used by:** Atlan, potentially S&OP plays

---

### Template 4: "Outcome, Not Tool"

```
"People don't want tools for [role] — they want [outcomes].

Legacy software tracks work done by humans.

We provide AI that does the work itself.

We charge for [outcome] not [seats]."
```

**Used by:** 11x.ai, Artisan, Sierra

---

## Part 6: Applying to S&OP / Supply Chain

### The S&OP Pitch Using These Frameworks

**Opening (The Obsolescence Frame):**
> "S&OP software today is a system of record for decisions made by humans. Planning teams spend 90% of their time assembling information, not making decisions. AI will make this model obsolete."

**The Context Problem (Atlan/Prukalpa Frame):**
> "The real S&OP intelligence lives in Slack threads, escalation calls, and people's heads. Every exception, every override, every precedent. This context is never captured. AI agents need this context to actually work."

**The Solution (Jaya Gupta Frame):**
> "We capture the decision traces that power S&OP. Not just the numbers, but how conflicts were resolved, who approved what, which precedents govern reality. We make this searchable."

**Why Now:**
> "LLMs can now reason across functions, understand trade-offs, and explain their recommendations. For the first time, we can have AI that participates in S&OP, not just reports on it."

**Proof Points Needed:**
- X% faster consensus in S&OP meetings
- Y% reduction in demand-supply mismatch
- Z decisions captured and reused per cycle
- $W saved in exception handling
